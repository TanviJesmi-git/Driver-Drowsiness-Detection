Driver Drowsiness & Distraction Detection System

This repository contains a real-time Driver Drowsiness & Distraction Detection System that uses computer vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite) to monitor driver alertness by analyzing eye closure, blink patterns, and head posture. It classifies driver states as Alert, Medium Drowsy, Critical Drowsy, or Distracted, and includes an API for modular integration, enabling deployment in different applications such as in-car monitoring or simulation platforms.

üìñ Overview

Problem it solves
Drowsy and distracted driving is a leading cause of road accidents. Traditional blink-only detection systems often raise false alarms or miss distraction cues.

Why it‚Äôs important/interesting
This project improves accuracy and real-time adaptability by combining:

Head Pose Estimation ‚Üí Detects sustained looking down, up, or sideways (captures distraction/microsleep).

PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure) ‚Üí A validated fatigue metric measuring eye closure duration, applied only when the driver looks forward.

Blink Detection (EAR) ‚Üí Provides real-time eye state for tracking blinks and closures.

Grace-Period Logic ‚Üí Prevents false alerts from natural short glances.

REST API ‚Üí Offers programmatic access to drowsiness classification results, making the system extendable to web apps, mobile dashboards, or vehicle integrations.

Together, these modules work as a robust, real-time fatigue monitoring system.

üîç Comparison with Existing Systems
Feature	Blink-only Systems	Our System (Blink + Head Pose + PERCLOS + API)
Detection Accuracy	Prone to false alarms from normal blinks	Higher accuracy by combining multiple cues
Handles Distraction	‚ùå No (only monitors eyes)	‚úÖ Yes (head pose detects left, right, down, up)
Adaptability	Limited, static thresholds	‚úÖ Dynamic with PERCLOS + grace-period logic
Integration	Standalone only	‚úÖ API support for deployment & external apps
Real-time Performance	Basic blink counting	‚úÖ ~20 FPS with integrated metrics
